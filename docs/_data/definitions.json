Each action is associated with a specific behavior that can be performed on the component.\n>\n ðŸ‘‰ Actions receive an `options` object as an argument, which contains the necessary information to perform the action.\n>\n ðŸ‘‰ When called from triggers, the properties defined in their `data-smark` object, are passed as `options` to the action. Those expecting a path(â˜… ) to other components are resolved to the actual component.\n",

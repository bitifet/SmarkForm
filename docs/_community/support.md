  [https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions)
- **Bug reports:** open a GitHub Issue
  [https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/issues](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/issues)

  [https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions/categories/ideas](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions/categories/ideas)
- **Security or private reports:** email
  [smarkform@bitifet.net](mailto:smarkform@bitifet.net)

**Before asking:**
- Check the documentation and FAQ: [About → FAQ](/about/faq).
- Search existing [Discussions](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions) and [Issues](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/issues) to avoid duplicates.

## Community support (Q&A)

Use Discussions for questions, usage help, and troubleshooting:
- [https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/discussions)

To get a faster answer, include:

- Minimal reproducible example (code snippet, repository, or link)
- Screenshots or logs if useful

## Bug reports

Report at: [https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/issues](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/issues)

Checklist:
- Steps to reproduce (step-by-step)
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment (SmarkForm version, OS, browser)
- Minimal reproduction (repo/snippet) whenever possible
- Related logs, stack traces, or screenshots

Issues that include a minimal repro are much faster to triage and fix.

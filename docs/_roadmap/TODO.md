## UX Improvements

### ðŸ‘‰ Keyboard Shortcuts
  - Allow component types to capture keyboard events to trigger actions.
  - I.e. Ctrl+"+" in list item may add new item below (trigger addItem action
    with that item as target).
  - I.e. Ctrl+"-" in list item may remove the item containing it (trigger
    removeItem action with that item as target).


## Pending core features


### ðŸ‘‰ The API interface

Bla bla bla...



### ðŸ‘‰ *src* property for import action

Taking advantadge of the API interface it will not only allow for loading data
from static source:

The API interface will allow to use other fields values as arguments for the
API request to perform everty time the action is triggered.


## Pending core components


### ðŸ‘‰ The Â«selectÂ» component

...


## Other possible features


### ðŸ’¡ Implement Focus subsystem. Let's say:
  - AddItem send focus to added Item.
  - This item (type) in turn, may re-send it to inner parts (i.e.: first
    input for forms, etc...)


## New non-core components

The following are ideas for possible future components (not necessarily and in
most cases they won't be core components but just plugable components in their
own repository.

### ðŸ’¡ Implement UNDO component.
  - Contains single component (form, list, input...).
  - Acts as a "man in the middle".
  - Listen to the (future) component's "change" events to capture (export)
    and store changes.
  - Make its own changes' events distinguishable from regular ones (to avoid
    re-caching).
  - Provide additional "undo" and "redo" actions.
  - Etc...

### ðŸ’¡ Implement Table Of Contents component.
  - Scan targetted component recursively.
  - Refresh on every change (add or remove items).
  - Show only components with a "toc-section" property.
  - Allow navigating to every secton through their (full path) id's.
  - Implement a "return to TOC" actions.
  - Stop scanning on compoenents containing a self-targetted TOC.

### ðŸ’¡ Implement a Â«multiformÂ» component type.
  - Multiple subform templates (every direct child) internally stored (like
    in lists...).
  - Only one actually inserted in DOM (interchangeably).
  - import() and export() methods work always over currently selected subform.
  - Each subform must include a <select> (or any other input smart type) tag
    whose name should match some "selector" field in the options object
    passed to mulitform component (data-smark property) and whose value
    should decide wich template is actually used (making imports and exports
    consistent thanks to this field).
  - Consider using an special action instead of that <select> tag so that it
    can freely placed inside or outside multiform component subtemplates (in
    this case, the "selector" field sholuld be maintained "maically" by
    compoenent's internals).



## Spare Ideas

Spare (not yet mature) random ideas...

### Implement download action

  * Implement in lib/component.js.
  * Rely on (each type)'s export action.
  * Allow to specify file name (maybe even prompt...)
  * Downloads (exported) json by default
  * ...but allow for transformation filters to generate other kinds of data
    from json input.


**Sample code for download fuctionality:**

```javascript
function download(fileName, payload, ctype = "text/plain", charset="utf-8") {
    var dldAnchor = document.createElement('a');
    dldAnchor.setAttribute('href', `data:${ctype};charset=${charset},${encodeURIComponent(payload)}`);
    dldAnchor.setAttribute('download', fileName);
    dldAnchor.style.display = 'none';
    document.body.appendChild(dldAnchor);
    dldAnchor.click();
    document.body.removeChild(dldAnchor);
}

// Usage example
download(myFile.json, {foo: "bar"});
```

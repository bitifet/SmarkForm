SmarkForm implementation is stable and fully functional, but not all initially
planned requirements are yet implemented. Hence, it's not yet in the 1.0.0
version.

It still lacks two of its planned key features:

  * The API Interface.
  * The [:link: `<select>` component type]({{ /component_types/type_select |
    relative_url }}).

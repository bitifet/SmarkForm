To incorporate **SmarkForm** to your project you have several alternatives:


## Using a CDN (Esiest approach)

{: .hint}
> This is the quicker method for playground and testing apps.


### ES module

ðŸ‘‰ Import it as ES module:

```html
<script type="module">
  import SmarkForm from '{{ smarkform_esm_cdn_latest }}';
  
  // Use SmarkForm in your code
</script>
```


### UMD Module

ðŸ‘‰ Include it your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}"></script>
<script>
    // Now it is avalable as SmarkForm global variable.
</script>
```

ðŸ‘‰ Import as CommonJS module:

```javascript
const SmarkForm = require("{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}");
```

ðŸ‘‰ Import as AMD (RequireJS) module:

```javascript
require(['{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}'], function(SmarkForm) {
  // Now it is avalable as SmarkForm local variable.
});
```


{: .warning}
> ðŸ“Œ These examples will use the latest published version of SmarkForm from
> NPM (better for development / testing / training).
> 
> For production code is advised to rely on specific version CDN to keep it
> working despite any future changes.
> 
> See [CDN Resources section](
> {{ "/resources/CDN#specific-version" | relative_url }}) for more details...


## Download minified

Go to [Download section]({{ "/resources/download" | relative_url }}) to obtain a
minified versionof Smarkform you can then serve toghether with your app.


## Installing it from NPM

ðŸ‘‰ Execute:

```sh
npm install smarkform
```

ðŸ‘‰  Then you can use it with your favourite bundler or pick it in your preferred
format:

```
node_modules
â””â”€â”€ smarkform
    â””â”€â”€ dist
        â”œâ”€â”€ SmarkForm.esm.js
        â””â”€â”€ SmarkForm.umd.js
```

{: .hint }
> *SmarkForm.umd.js* can be loaded from regular ``<script>`` tag and will export
> ``SmarkForm`` class as global variable.


## Clone from GitHub



ðŸ‘‰ Execute:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bitifet/SmarkForm.git
```

ðŸ‘‰ Then, like with NPM package, you will find it under *dist* directory:

```
dist
â”œâ”€â”€ SmarkForm.esm.js
â””â”€â”€ SmarkForm.umd.js
```

{: .hint}
> You can also install dev dependencies by running ``npm install`` and then
> 
> - ``npm run build``: To build after doing some change.
> - ``npm run dev``: To build and watch for any source file change and auto rebuild as needed.
> - ``npm run test``: To run automated tests.
> - ``npm start``: To run Express server with the playground environment.

## Available formats

**SmarkForm** is provided in two alternative formats:

  * **ESM module (SmarkForm.esm.js)** which is built as an ECMAScript module
    (ESM) and can be imported directly using the ``import`` statement in modern
    *JavaScript* environments. It allows for
    [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking) and efficient
    module management. 

  * **UMD (SmarkForm.umd.js)** which is a universal format that works both in
    browsers and in module systems like CommonJS and AMD. It can be loaded
    through any [UMD compatibley module loader](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)
    such as [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) or directly via a <script> tag,
    where it will export the SmarkForm class as a global variable.


To incorporate **SmarkForm** to your project you have several alternatives:


## Using a CDN (Esiest approach)

{: .hint}
> This is the quicker method for playground and testing apps.


### ES module

👉 Import it as ES module:

```html
<script type="module">
  import SmarkForm from '{{ smarkform_esm_cdn_latest }}';
  
  // Use SmarkForm in your code
</script>
```


### UMD Module

👉 Include it your HTML file using a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}"></script>
<script>
    // Now it is avalable as SmarkForm global variable.
</script>
```

👉 Import as CommonJS module:

```javascript
const SmarkForm = require("{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}");
```

👉 Import as AMD (RequireJS) module:

```javascript
require(['{{ smarkform_umd_cdn_latest }}'], function(SmarkForm) {
  // Now it is avalable as SmarkForm local variable.
});
```


{: .warning}
> 📌 These examples will use the latest published version of SmarkForm from
> NPM (better for development / testing / training).
> 
> For production code is advised to rely on specific version CDN to keep it
> working despite any future changes.
> 
> See [CDN Resources section](
> {{ "/resources/CDN#specific-version" | relative_url }}) for more details...


## Download minified

Go to [Download section]({{ "/resources/download" | relative_url }}) to obtain a
minified versionof Smarkform you can then serve toghether with your app.


## Installing it from NPM

👉 Execute:

```sh
npm install smarkform
```

👉  Then you can use it with your favourite bundler or pick it in your preferred
format:

```
node_modules
└── smarkform
    └── dist
        ├── SmarkForm.esm.js
        └── SmarkForm.umd.js
```

{: .hint }
> If you're using [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and
> want to avoid publishing your entire ``node_modules`` directory or manually configuring custom
> routes, you can use the [ESMrouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esmrouter)
> package from NPM. This package simplifies routing for ECMAScript modules in
> Express, saving you time and effort.


## Clone from GitHub

👉 Execute:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bitifet/SmarkForm.git
```

👉 Then, like with NPM package, you will find everything under the *dist*
directory:

```
dist
├── SmarkForm.esm.js
├── SmarkForm.esm.js.map
├── SmarkForm.umd.js
├── SmarkForm.umd.js.map
└── examples
    ├── smarkform_layout_sample.css
    └── smarkform_styles_sample.css
```

{: .info}
> You can also install dev dependencies by running ``npm run dev`` to start
> developping or ``npm run bundle`` to just rebuild everything.
> 
> For more information, execute ``npm run`` alone:
> 
> ```sh
> $ npm run
> Lifecycle scripts included in smarkform@0.5.1:
>   pretest
>     npm run build
>   test
>     mocha
> available via `npm run-script`:
>   build
>     scripts/build_production_smarkform.sh
>   doc
>     scripts/build_documentation_site.sh
>   bundle
>     scripts/build_all.sh
>   watch
>     scripts/livebuild_dev_smarkform.sh
>   servedoc
>     scripts/liveserve_documentation_site.sh

  (ðŸš§ Working examples, without technical explanation, just to show implemented capabilities)


ðŸ‘‰ This document is still in draft stage.

The following random text snippets are just reminders of what should be included in this document:



It imports and exports data in JSON format

nested forms


variable-length lists


properly sanitizes and formats values according to its field type



implements declarative restrictions like wether null is allowed or not


maximum and minimum length for lists



smooth and intuitive user experience


such as forcing `type="color"` fields to always hold a valid color value



context-driven keyboard shortcuts


smart auto-enablement/disablement of controls

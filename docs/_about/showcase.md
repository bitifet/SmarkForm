## Basic Form

To begin with the basics, we'll start with a simple form that includes a few
input fields (left side) and a textarea (right side) which will allow you to:

  * <li data-bullet="➡️ ">Export the form to the textarea in JSON format.
    <li data-bullet="❌ ">Clear the form whenever you want.
  * Edit the JSON as you like.
    <li data-bullet="⬅️ "> Import the JSON back to the form.</li>
  * See the effects of your changes.


{% raw %} <!-- capture basic_form_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}
👉 Notice that **most SmarkForm fields can be null**, meaning the data is
unknown or indifferent.

  * In the case of radio buttons, if no option is selected, they evaluate to
    null. Even after a value is set, they allow unselectiong the selected option
    either by clicking on it again or by pressing the `Delete` key.
  * Even color pickers can be null even [native HTML color inputs
    can't](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color#value).
  * To reset a color picker after a color being set, you can use the `❌`
    button to call it's "clear" *action*.

👉 **This kind of *SmarkForm* components** intended to call *actions* on
*SmarkForm* fields **are called *triggers*.**

  * There are several other *actions* that can be called on *SmarkForm* fields.
    Some, such as *import* and *export* are common to all field types and
    others are specific to some of them. For instance *addItem* and *removeItem*
    are specific to lists.

👉 Also notice the `{"encoding":"json"}` bit in the `<select>` dropdown.

  * This allow it to return a Null value when the first option is selected.
  * It also foreces to wrap other values in double quotes to make them valid
    JSON strings.
  * ...unless the *value* property is omitted, in which case inner text is
    used "as is".

{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="basic_form"
    notes=notes
%}


{: .info :}

## Nested forms

Let's add a few more fields to the form to provide information regarding
included safety equipment. This time we'll group them in a nested subform under
the name "safety".


{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="nested_forms"
%}



👉 Despite of usability concerns, there is no limit in form nesting depth. For
instance, all the examples in this chapter are entirely built with SmarkForm
itself.

  * If you look closer to the HTML source, you will see that `⬅️` and `➡️`
    buttons only imports/exports a subform called *demo* from/to a *textarea*
    field called *editor*.

  * ...And if you look at its *JS* tab you'll see that **there is no JavaScript
    code except for the SmarkForm instantiation** itself.

{: .info :}
> 👉 The trick here is that you did not import/export the whole form but just a
> subform.
>
>   * In fact, 🚀  **the whole *SmarkForm* form is a field of the type *form***
>     that imports/exports JSON and 🚀  **they can be nested up to any depth**.
>
>   * The `➡️ `, `⬅️ ` and `❌` buttons are *trigger* components that perform
>     specialized actions (look at the *HTML* tab to see how...). 🚀 **No
>     JavaScript wiring is needed**.



{: .hint :}
> In the [Import and Export Data](#import-and-export-data) section we'll go
> deeper into the *import* and *export* actions and how to get the most of
> them.


## Lists

One of the most powerful features of SmarkForm is its ability to handle variable-length lists.

Let's say you need to collect phone numbers or emails from users. Instead of
having (and dealing with it) a fixed number of input fields, you can use a list
that can grow or shrink as needed:


{% raw %} <!-- capture simple_list_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}
  * By default, empty items in lists are not expoted to keep data clean.
  * But for this very first example, we added the `{exportEmpties: true}`
    option so that you can see every added item no matter if you typed anything
    or not.
{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="simple_list"
    notes=notes
%}


Here we used a simpple `<input>` field for each item in the list and had to
trick them with `style="display: block;"` to make them to stack gracefully.

But **lists are even more powerful** than that:

For instance, we could have used a *form* field instead, but in this case we
would had get a JSON object for each item in the list, which is not what we
want in this specific case.

👉 To address this issue, we can take advantage of the *singleton pattern* to make
any HTML element to become a regular *input* field.


{: .info :}
> We call the *singleton pattern* when we use any HTML element different from
> `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`, etc., as a regular input field.
>
> For this to work we only need to place one **and only one** of these elements
> (with the "data-smark" attribute since otherwise they are ignored) in its
> contents.

This way we can not only use a more elaborated structure for each item in the
list: It also allows us to include other controls within every list item, like
in the following example:


{% raw %} <!-- capture simple_list_singleton_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}
👉 In this example we:
  * Established a maximum of 5 items in the list.
  * Allowed the list to be empty (default minimum items is 1).
  * Defined an alternate template for the case of empty list.
  * Made the `➖` button a little smarter so that it removes empty items, if
    any, first.
  * Added a `🧹` button to remove all empty items.
  * Added a `❌` button to each item to cherry-pick which items to remove.
  * Returned to the default behaviour of not exporting empty items.
  * Made it sortable (by dragging and dropping items).
{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="simple_list_singleton"
    notes=notes
%}

{: .hint :}
> Again, don't miss to check the `📝 Notes` tab for more powerful insights and
> tips.

👉 And there is a lot more... To begin with, another interesting use case for
lists is to create a schedule list like the following example:

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="schedule_list"
%}



👉 Or we could have wanted a more formal (or better aligned, in case of multiple schedules) layout such as a table:

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="schedule_table"
%}



## Nested lists and forms


Since we can make lists of forms, we can also nest more forms and lists inside
every list item and so forth to any depth.


{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="nested_lists"
%}



{: .warning :}
> Section still under construction...



There is no theoretical limit to the depth of nesting beyond the logical
usability concerns.

Here is a more complex example with a deeply nested form:






{% raw %} <!-- capture deeply_nested_forms_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}
👉 FIXME!!
{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}


{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="deeply_nested_forms"
    notes=notes
%}



{: .hint :}
> These are just simple examples to show the concept. You can see more
> elaborated examples in the [Examples]({{ "resources/examples" | relative_url }})
> section of this documentation.












## Import and Export Data

Exporting and importing data in SmarkForm cannot be easier. 

Let's recall the example in the [Nested forms](#nested-forms) section.

There we learnt that the `➡️ ` and `⬅️ ` buttons used in all examples in this
chapter are just *triggers* that call the *export* and *import* actions on a
subform called "demo" **(their *context*)**:

  * 
    <li data-bullet="➡️ ">Exports the "demo" subform to the "editor" textarea <b>(its target)</b>.</li>
    <li data-bullet="⬅️ ">Imports the JSON data from the "editor" textarea to the "demo" subform <b>(its target)</b>.</li>

{: .hint :}
> This is a very handy use case for the *import* and *export* actions because
> it does not require any additional JavaScript code.
>
> But this are not the only way to use the *import* and *export* actions.


### Intercepting the *import* and *export* events

Below these lines you can see **the exact same form** with additional `💾` and
`📂` buttons and a little additional JavaScript code to mock the "save" and
"load" operations through window's `alert()` and `prompt()`, reespectively.


{% raw %} <!-- capture nested_forms_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}

👉 Since `💾` and `📂` buttons are in the higher context level, in this case we
used a litle JavaScript code intercepting the related events to, resepectively,
show the whole form in a `window.alert(...)` dialog and import a new JSON data
to the whole form throught a `window.prompt(...)`.

  * The JavaScript code in this example is, in fact, a little more complex than
    it would be needed just to avoid interfering the '➡️ ' and ' ⬅️ ' that also
    rely on the *export* and *import* actions.

  * And, as a **BONUS**, the *BeforeAction_import* event handler performs a soft
    *export* to prefill the prompt dialog (so that you can edit the JSON data
    instead of manually copying ot writing it from scratch).
    <li data-bullet="👉">See the JS tab to see how the <em>BeforeAction_import</em> event handler prefills the prompt dialog with the JSON export of the whole form.</li>


{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}


{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="nested_forms_with_load_save"
    notes=notes
%}

👉 Here you can:

  * Repeat all the same trials as in the beforementioned [Nested
    forms](#nested-forms)' example (with identical results).
  * Use the `💾` button to export the whole form to a `window.alert(...)` dialog.
  * Use the `📂` button to import new JSON data to the whole form.

### Submitting the form

{: .warning :}
> 🚧 Section still under construction...   🚧





## A note on context of the triggers

Let's return to the [Nested forms](#nested-forms)' example.

In that example we had the `💾` and `📂` buttons opeating on the whole form
because it is their *natural* context.

In the case of the `➡️ `, `⬅️ ` and `❌` buttons, they have their context
explicitly set by the option of the same name.

{: .hint :}
> We could have wanted to make the `💾` and `📂` buttons to operate only on the
> *demo* subform.
> 
> To do so, we could have set their *context* property to "demo", in which case
> then they would have exported/imported the same data than `➡️ ` and `⬅️ `
> buttons.
>
> Or, alternatively, 🚀 we could just have placed them inside of that context
> **in the markup** as it is shown in the following example:



{% raw %} <!-- capture basic_form_with_local_import_export_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}

If you compare the *JS* tab with the one in fhe former one,
you'll see that there is a little difference between them.

👉 In the first one, the "BeforeActionImport" and "AfterActionExport"
event handlers inhibits themselves depending on whether the context is the
root form or not while, in the later, it just focus on the fact that the
*target* is not provided.

👉 The second is a more generic approach for this kind of event handlers. But
the first one serves as an alternative example showing how we can base those
event handlers' behaviour on the specific context (path) of every trigger.

🚀 Just for the sake of showing the power of event handlers, in this case, the
*BeforeActionImport* event handler have been evolved to fill the prompt dialog
with the JSON export of the form when the *target* is not provided.

{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}


{: .hint :}
{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="basic_form_with_local_import_export"
    notes=notes
%}

👉 Now the `💾 Save` and `📂 Load` buttons work on the "/demo" path (that is:
they only import/export the "demo" subform) just like `➡️` and `⬅️` ones do but
without explicitly specifying their context. **They just receive their context
by the place they are in the form**.


{: .info :}
> For the sake of simplicity (except for the following example) from now on,
> having we already demonstrated how to work with *import* and *export*
> actions' events, we'll stick to the layout of the very first example (`➡️ `,
> `⬅️` and `❌` buttons targetting the "editor" textarea) that doesn't need any
> additional JS code.


👌 If you want a clearer example on how the context affect the triggers, take a
look to the following example:

{% raw %} <!-- capture context_comparsion_example_notes {{{ --> {% endraw %}
{% capture notes %}
👉 Notice that **all *Import* and *Export* buttons (triggers) are handled
by the same event handlers** (for "BeforeAction_import" and
"AfterAction_export", respectively).

👉 **They belong to different *SmarkForm* fields** determined by **(1)**
where they are placed in the DOM and **(2)** the relative path from that
place pointed by the *context* property.

ℹ️  Different field types may import/export different data types (*forms*
import/export JSON while regular *inputs* import/export text).

🔧 For the sake of simplicity, the *BeforeAction_import* event handler
reads the previous value of the field (no matter its type) and provides it
stringified as JSON as default value for the window.prompt() call. Making
it easy to edit the value no matter if we are importing one of the text
fields or the whole form.
{% endcapture %}{% raw %} <!-- }}} --> {% endraw %}


{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="context_comparsion"
    notes=notes
%}


### ✋ Don't panic!!

If you felt overwhelmed by the previous example's JavaScript code, don't worry.
It was just to show off the power of the *event handlers*.

Look at this other version of the former example with zero JavaScript (despite
SmarkForm instantiation itself):

{% include_relative
    examples/showcase.examples.md
    option="context_comparsion_simple"
%}

🚀 As you can see, the same actions can be applied to different parts of the
form just by placing the triggers in the right place or explicitly setting the
right path to the desired *context*.

👉 You can *import*, *export* or *clear* either the whole form or any of its
fields. Try exporting / exporting / clearing the whole form or individual
fields whith the help of the "JSON data viewer / editor".

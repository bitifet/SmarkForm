## Markup agnostic

Leverage your existing HTML and CSS knowledge to create powerful forms with no
effort.

  * Markup-driven and Intuitive API

    - Just add the *data-smark* attribute to form fields to
      enhance them:
      ```html
      <input name="user" type="text" data-smark>
      ```
    - And initialize the form with a single line of JavaScript:
      ```javascript
      const myForm = new SmarkForm(form_container);
      ```

  * Does not impose any specific HTML structure or CSS design rules.

    - Designers have complete freedom.

    - Developers don't have to worry about layout changes.


ðŸ‘‰  See the [Quick Start]({{ "/getting_started/quick_start" | relative_url }})
section for more details.


## Easy to use (low-code)

  * *Zero-Wiring*: Controls (called *trigger* components) reach their target
    fields by its *context* (position in the form) or by relative paths within
    the form.
    ```html
    <button data-smark='{"action": "addItem", "context": "contacts"}'>âž• Add contact</button>
    <button data-smark='{"action": "export"}'>ðŸ’¾ Save</button>
    ```

  * To handle data import and export from your own code, you just have to
    listen to `onBeforeAction_import` and `onAfterAction_export` events.
    ```javascript
    myForm.on("afterAction_export", ({data}) => {
        console.log("Exported data:", data);
    });
    ```

  * Of course, you can also call the `.import()` and `.export()` methods of
    the whole form (or any field) to import or export data programmatically.

ðŸ‘‰ Take a look to the [Showcase]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#nested-forms)
section to realize how easy it is to create complex forms with little or no
JavaScript code.


## Nestable forms

  * Forms are just fields of the *form* type that import/export their data as
    JSON.
    ```html
    <fieldset data-smark='{"type": "form", "name": "details"}'>
        <!-- ... -->
    </fieldset>
    ```

  * They can be nested to any depth.

  * The whole SmarkForm enhanced form is a field of this type.

ðŸ‘‰ [See them in action...]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#nested-forms).


## Variable-length lists

  * Variable-lenght lists of scalars or subforms.
    - With configurable minimum and maximum length.
    - Users can add or remove items by clicking on appropriate buttons
      (*trigger* components) configured to call the *addItem* and *removeItem*
      actions.

  * Data is imported/exported as JSON arrays.
    - If non array is attempted to be imported, it is converted to an array
      with a single item.

  * Can be manually (user drag & drop) or automatically (ðŸš§ comming soon...)
    sorted.

ðŸ‘‰ [See them in action...]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#lists).


## Context driven hotkeys

  * Attach a keyboard shotcut to a trigger by just adding a `hotkey`
    property to the trigger component.
    - Ex.: `<button data-smark='{action: "addItem", hotkey: "+"}'>Add Item</button>`.
    - Then use `Ctrl`+`+` to add an item to the list.

  * Allow users to discover available hotkeys by pressing `Ctrl` key.
    - Every time the user presses/releases `Ctrl`, all triggers with a
      reachable *hotkey* will get the `data-hotkey` attribute of the their DOM
      element is filled/unfilled with the hotkey value.
    - This allows for a very simple
      [CSS arrangement]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#context-driven-keyboard-shortcuts-hot-keys)
      for auto-reveal/unreveal feature.

  * Avoid hotkey cluttering by reusing the same hotkey in different contexts.
    - Hotkeys are attached to triggers and triggers are context-aware.
    - If the same hotkey is used more than once, only the one in the nearest
      context (depending on the current focus) is activated.

ðŸ‘‰ [See it in action...]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#context-driven-keyboard-shortcuts-hot-keys).


## Consistent User Experience

  * Smooth navigation across all forms.
    - Use `Tab` and `Shift`+`Tab` as usual to navigate between fields and controls.
    - Use `Enter` and `Shift`+`Enter` to navigate between fields only, bypassing
      controls.
      - Use `Ctrl`+`Enter` instead of `Enter` in multiline (textarea) fields.

  * Non-breaking unobtrusive keyboard navigation: triggers are smartly added or
    removed from navigation flow (with tab) when there is a hotkey to reach
    them.

  * Automatically enabled/disabled controls (depending on context).
    - **I.e.:** *Add Item* and *Remove Item* triggers are automatically
      disabled when the list is full or empty, respectively.

ðŸ‘‰ [Learn more...]({{ "/about/showcase" | relative_url }}#smooth-navigation).


## JSON based

  * Every single field can import/export its data in the appropriate data type:
    - Forms as JSON objects.
    - Lists as JSON arrays.
    - Numbers as numbers.
    - Dates as well-formed date strings.
    - Booleans as booleans.

## Lightweight yet highly compatible


  * Just {{ site.data.computed.bundleSizeKB | xml_escape | textilize }}KB minified!

  * Bundled both as modern ES Module and UMD for wide compatibility.

  * &gt; 0.25%, browser coverage thanks to Babel


ðŸ‘‰ [Check it out...]({{ "/getting_started/getting_smarkform" | relative_url }})



## Flexible and extendable

  * Develop your own component types to suit your specific needs.

  * ðŸš§ (Not yet implemented) Create you own components on top of SmarkForm
    templates (I.e.: a complex schedule form returning well known JSON
    structure).


## Directory-like addressability

  * Address any field by from another field by its relative or absolute path.

  * Those paths traverse the form structure: not the DOM.
    - ðŸš€ This give you full freedom to **alter the form layout without
      breaking the code**.

  * They are highly useful to alter triggers' context and/or targetted
    fields.

  * They support upper (`..`) and sibling (`.-1`) addressing to traverse lists
    hoizontally and even wildcards (`*`) to address multiple fields at once.


ðŸ‘‰ See the [Form Traversing]({{ "/advanced_concepts/form_traversing" | relative_url }})
section for more details.


## Reliability-oriented

  * It handles edge cases gracefully:
    - If non-Array is attempted to be imported into a list, it is converted
      to an array with a single item.
    - Textarea fields automatically stringify and pretty-print objects.

  * Null awareness:
    - Non text fields (like number, date, checkbox, etc.) can return `null` to
      indicate that the value is unknown or not applicable.
    - Radiobuttons can be unckecked.
    - Color pickers can be cleared and return `null` to distinguish when the
      color is unknown or not applicable instead of defaulting to black.

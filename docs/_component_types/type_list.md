Introduction
------------

The List component in SmarkForm allows you to dynamically manage a list of
items within your form.

üëâ All lists direct childs (before rendering) are considered *templates* with
different *roles*.

üëâ Default role is "item", which is used as a template for each item in the
list. This template is mandatory.

üëâ Other roles are "empty_list" (displayed when the list is empty) and, not yet
implemented, "separator" and "last_separator".

üëâ Likewise [forms]({{ "component_types/type_form" | relative_url }}), *list*
inputs can be created over any HTML tag1Ô∏è‚É£  **except for actual HTML form
elements** (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<button>`...).


### List items

üëâ Lists can contain a variable number of unnamed inputs (list items) of a given
type.

üëâ However, in its html source, **lists must only contain templates of supported roles as direct
childs**2Ô∏è‚É£ , being the "item" role required and the rest optional.

üëâ The user will (or won't) be able to, at its own discretion (and according
certain configurable rules), add or remove items to the list.

üëâ Every time a new item is added to the list, **its item template is
automatically rendered as a *SmarkForm* field** (no matter if we explicitly
specified the *data-smark* attribute or not).

üëâ If *data-smark* attribute is not provided (or it does not specify the
*type* property), the type "form" is automatically taken by default3Ô∏è‚É£ .

**Example:**

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="simple_list" %}



### Scalar item types

üëâ Other field types can be used too as *item template*4Ô∏è‚É£ .

üëâ ...but, in the case of
([scalar field types]({{ "getting_started/core_component_types#scalar-field-types" | relative_url }}))
it may look like we are limited when it comes to inserting labels **and
triggers** in the item template and hence we can only remove last item every
time in the list.

This would force us to move the *Remove Item* button outside the list5Ô∏è‚É£  like in the
following example.


**Example:**

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="scalar_list" %}

{: .hint}
> Notice that in this example, likewise the *fieldset* in the former, the
> *input* tag has no "name" attribute6Ô∏è‚É£ . This is because it is a list item
> template and it's actual name attribute will be automatically set depending
> on its position in the array every time a new item is added, moved or
> removed.

üëâ Now, when the user clicks the *Remove Item* button, it will default to the
last item of the list, **but we cannot ([yet](#applying-the-singleton-pattern))
cherry-pick which item we'd like to remove**.


### Applying the singleton pattern


Thankfully, all *Scalar field types* implement the
[Singleton Pattern]({{ "/getting_started/core_component_types#the-singleton-pattern" | relative_url }})
so that we can use any other html tag in place and just put the form field tag
inside.

**Example:**

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="singleton_list" %}

{: .info}
> In this example we have omitted the `type: "list"` bit and still works because
> *SmarkForm* automatically inferes the type from the HTML tag.
> 
> {: .warning}
> > This is handy for fast developping but it is **not a recommended practice**
> > since our designer may decide to change the tag for the template and different
> > type could be infered.


### Nesting lists

Since they're just smarkform fields, *lists* can be nested as needed.

Now we are prepared to extend our initial *Users list* example by providding,
say, up to three phone numbers and up to three emails.


**Example:**

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="nesting_list" %}


{: .hint}
> As you can see here, phones and emails lists share almost the same layout.
> 
> Since *SmarkForm* works just over the DOM, you can use your preferred HTML 
> templating system. For instance, 
> [here](https://github.com/bitifet/SmarkForm/blob/main/src/examples/include/mixins.pug)
> you can see a similar *mixin* implemented whith [Pug templates](https://pugjs.org).
> 
> Also it 
> [is planned]({{ "about/features" | relative_url }}#flexible-and-extendable)
> to implement a *mixin* feature allowing to create SmarkForm components from
> *SmarkForm* html code.

please refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference).


API Reference
-------------

### Options

#### min_items

Establishes the minimum number of items allowed.

  * **Type:** Number
  * **Default value:** 1
  * **Minimum value:** 0


#### max_items

Establishes the maximum number of items allowed.

  * **Type:** Number
  * **Default value:** Infinity
  * **Minimum value:** Infinity


#### sortable

Controls wether the list can be user sorted by dragging and dropping list items.

  * **Type:** Boolean
  * **Default value:** false

{: .hint}
> Drag and Drop events are not natively supported by touch devices.
>
> They can be emulated in serveral ways. A quite straighforward one is through the *dragdroptouch* library from Bernardo Castilho:
>
> üîó [https://github.com/drag-drop-touch-js/dragdroptouch](https://github.com/drag-drop-touch-js/dragdroptouch)


#### exportEmpties

Controls whether unfilled list items should be exported or not. This allows for
neater arrays when the user adds more items to the list than are used.

  * **Type:** Boolean
  * **Default value:** false


#### of

Specify a field type for list items. Handy to avoid spacifying a whole
*data-smark* attribute in the template to just specify the field type when
needed.

  * **Type:** string
  * **Default value:** undefined


### Actions


#### (Async) export (Action)

  * **origin:**
  * **context:**
  * **target:**
  * **data:** (array / any¬π)
  * **focus:** (boolean, default true)


{: .hint}
> ¬π) If non array value is provided as *data*, then it is automatically wrapped
> as such as a failback.

#### (Async) empty (Action)

(Shorhand for `import({data: []})`)

##### properties (empty)

  * **action:** (= "empty")
  * **origin:**
  * **context:**

  * **origin:**
  * **context:**
  * **target:**
  * **autoscroll:**  (= "elegant" / "self" / "parent" / *falsy*)
  * **keep_non_empty:** (boolean)
  * **failback:** (= "none" / "clear" / "throw" )


#### count (Action)

##### properties (count)

  * **action:**: (= "count")
  * **delta:**: (default 0)


#### position (Action)

##### properties (position)

  * **action:**: (= "position")
  * **offset:**: (default 1)




### Events

The List component emits the following events:

#### addItem (list Event)

Triggered when a new item is going to be added to the list.

üëâ This event occurs just **after** the new item node is created and **before**
it is actually inserted in the DOM.

**Properties:**

Event data contains the properties received by the originating `addItem`
action, plus the following properties:

  * `newItemTarget`: The new DOM element that is about to be inserted (not yet
    a component).

  * `onRendered`: A callback setter that allows executing code after the item
    being actually inserted in the DOM and rendered as a new child component of
    the list. The newly created child component is provided as an argument to
    the callback.


**Example:**

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="simple_list_animation_additem" %}


In this example, we add the CSS class `ingoing` to the new item before it is
rendered, and then change it by the class (`ongoing`) after it is rendered.

This way we can animate the insertion of a new item with a few CSS lines such
as follows:


#### removeItem (list Event)

Triggered when an item is going to be removed from the list. This event occurs
just **before** removing the item from the DOM and the list itself.

Event data contains the properties received by the originating `removeItem`
action, plus the following properties:

  * `oldItem`: The child component (Smark component) of the list that is about
    to be removed.

  * `oldItemTarget`: The DOM element that is about to be removed from the DOM
    (the targetNode of `oldItem`).

  * `onRemoved`: A callback setter that allows executing code after
    `oldItemTarget` is actually removed from the DOM and `oldItem` is removed
    from the list.  No arguments will be provided to this callback.


**Example:**

Following example extends the previous one adding a collapsing effect every
time an item is removed from the list.

{% include_relative examples/type_list.examples.md option="simple_list_animation_complete" %}



In this example, we add the `outgoing` CSS class to the item being removed so
that it can be easily animated with a few CSS.

Then it wait for the specified transition duration to elapse preventing the
item being actually removed from the DOM until animation finished.

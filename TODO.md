  ðŸ‘‰ Complete documentation.

Pending core features
---------------------

### ðŸ‘‰ The API interface

...


### ðŸ‘‰ "src" property for import action

Taking advantadge of the API interface it will not only allow for loading data
from static source:

The API interface will allow to use other fields values as arguments for the
API request to perform everty time the action is triggered.


Pending core components
-----------------------

### ðŸ‘‰ The "select" component

...


Other possible features
-----------------------

### ðŸ’¡ Implement Focus subsystem. Let's say:
  - AddItem send focus to added Item.
  - This item (type) in turn, may re-send it to inner parts (i.e.: first
    input for forms, etc...)


New non-core components
-----------------------

The following are ideas for possible future components (not necessarily and in
most cases they won't be core components but just plugable components in their
own repository.

### ðŸ’¡ Implement UNDO component.
  - Contains single component (form, list, input...).
  - Acts as a "man in the middle".
  - Listen to the (future) component's "change" events to capture (export)
    and store changes.
  - Make its own changes' events distinguishable from regular ones (to avoid
    re-caching).
  - Provide additional "undo" and "redo" actions.
  - Etc...

### ðŸ’¡ Implement Table Of Contents component.
  - Scan targetted component recursively.
  - Refresh on every change (add or remove items).
  - Show only components with a "toc-section" property.
  - Allow navigating to every secton through their (full path) id's.
  - Implement a "return to TOC" actions.
  - Stop scanning on compoenents containing a self-targetted TOC.

### ðŸ’¡ Implement a "multiform" component type.
  - Multiple subform templates (every direct child) internally stored (like
    in lists...).
  - Only one actually inserted in DOM (interchangeably).
  - import() and export() methods work always over currently selected subform.
  - Each subform must include a <select> (or any other input smart type) tag
    whose name should match some "selector" field in the options object
    passed to mulitform component (data-smark property) and whose value
    should decide wich template is actually used (making imports and exports
    consistent thanks to this field).
  - Consider using an special action instead of that <select> tag so that it
    can freely placed inside or outside multiform component subtemplates (in
    this case, the "selector" field sholuld be maintained "maically" by
    compoenent's internals).

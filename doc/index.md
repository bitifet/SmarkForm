## About SmarkForm

<details>
<summary>
<h3>Introduction</h2>
</summary>

SmarkForm simplifies the creation of interactive forms in web applications,
empowering designers to utilize custom templates and seamlessly incorporate
interaction through contextual actions.

Designers can enhance their templates by using their own HTML and CSS, without
the need to deal with complex JavaScript code. SmarkForm enables advanced
capabilities, such as adding or removing items from a list and dynamically
loading options for select dropdowns, even if they depend on the values of any
other field in the form. This can be achieved simply by adding the 'data-smark'
property to relevant tags.

Developers can leverage these templates as views to import and manipulate
complex data in JSON format. They also have the flexibility to access any
component in the form tree using simple path-style addresses or develop their
own custom component types.

> üöß **Please note** that select dropdowns are not yet implemented in the
> current version, but they are planned for inclusion in the upcoming 1.0.0
> release.

## The Basics

### The `data-smark` Attribute

The `data-smark` attribute is used in SmarkForm to identify and enhance
specific DOM elements (HTML tags) as SmarkForm components. It also provides the
required properties for their enhancement.

By using the `data-smark` attribute, you can mark elements to be transformed
into SmarkForm components, while the remaining elements are ignored by
SmarkForm.

> üìå The following are exceptions to this rule:
>
> 1. The DOM element passed to the SmarkForm constructor is always considered a
>    SmarkForm component.
> 2. The item template of a list component, which is the only allowed direct
>    child in the HTML source before rendering, is always a SmarkForm component
>    by default. In this case, the `data-smark` attribute can be omitted.

**Syntax:**

The `data-smark` attribute can be specified in three different ways:

1. Without any value (e.g., `<textarea ... data-smark>`).
   - In this case, the component type is inferred based on the actual tag. For
   example, it is inferred as an *input* type for `<textarea>`.

2. With a string value (e.g., `<div ... data-smark="singleton">`).
   - This is equivalent to `<div ... data-smark='{"type": "singleton"}'>`.

3. With a valid JSON string (e.g., `<div data-smark='{"type": "list", "name":
   "myList"}'>`).

**Mandatory attributes:**

The following attributes are mandatory:

- The `type` attribute is always necessary to determine which component type
  controller should be used for rendering the component. In many cases, it can be
  inferred based on the tag name or the presence of the `action` property, which
  forces the type to be "action".

- The `name` attribute is required for all non-action components.
   - If not explicitly provided, it can be inferred from the `name` property of
     the tag being enhanced. For example, `<input name="foo" data-smark>`.
   - If not provided and cannot be inferred, a randomly generated name will be
     used.

### Components and Actions

### Components

A SmarkForm *component* is just a DOM element (HTML tag) which has a
"data-smark" property providding a JSON-formatted *options* object.

It looks like as follows:

```html
<input data-smark='{type: "input"}'/>
```

> üìå If only type option is specified, it can be simplified as:
> ```html
> <input data-smark='input'/>
> ```
> ...or just leave it empty to let SmarkForm engine to figure out its type:
> ```html
> <input data-smark/>
> ```


### Actions

A SmarkForm *action* is a *component* of type "action" and a (mandatory)
property "action" pointing to the actual action to be taken when clicked.

For actions the *type* property can be omitted (since is infered by the
presence of the *action* property itself) but, if present, its value must be
"action".

**Example:**

```html
<button data-smark='{action: "removeItem"}'></button>
```

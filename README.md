<!-- Highlighting fix: []() -->

*SmarkForm* is a lightweight library designed for front-end developers and
designers to enhance HTML forms with powerful features like **subforms** and
dynamic, variable-length **lists**, context driven **hotkeys** and more...

🔧 It seamlessly integrates with the DOM to provide a markup-agnostic solution,
freeing your form layout from rigid structure and styling constraints while
enabling **JSON form data import and export** and ensuring compatibility with
modern workflows.

♿ With a focus on accessibility (a11y), SmarkForm offers configurable hotkeys,
**smooth navigation**, and a **low-code experience**, making it an extendable
and versatile tool for building HTML form applications.

## 30-second Example

A contact form with a dynamic phone-number list — no manual wiring, just markup:

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div id="myForm">
  <p><input name="name" data-smark placeholder="Name"></p>
  <ul data-smark='{"name":"phones","of":"input"}'>
    <li><input type="tel" data-smark placeholder="Phone"></li>
  </ul>
  <button data-smark='{"action":"addItem","context":"phones"}'>➕ Add phone</button>
  <button data-smark='{"action":"removeItem","context":"phones"}'>➖ Remove</button>
  <button data-smark='{"action":"export"}'>💾 Export JSON</button>
</div>
```

```javascript
// JS — one line to initialize
const myForm = new SmarkForm(document.getElementById("myForm"));

// Listen for the exported data
myForm.on("AfterAction_export", ({ data }) => console.log(data));
// → { name: "Alice", phones: ["555-1234", "555-5678"] }
```

That's it. No schema, no bindings, no callbacks per field.


## What SmarkForm Is (and Isn't Yet)

**SmarkForm is:**
- ✅ A **markup-driven** form controller: configuration lives in `data-smark`
  attributes, not JavaScript objects.
- ✅ **Markup-agnostic**: it imposes no HTML structure or CSS — you keep full
  design freedom.
- ✅ A tool for **JSON-based import/export** of complex, nested form data.
- ✅ Ready for **subforms**, **variable-length lists**, **context-driven hotkeys**,
  and smooth keyboard navigation.
- ✅ Stable and in active use, but still pre-1.0 (API may evolve).

**Not yet implemented (planned for a future release):**
- ❌ Built-in validation (field-level error messages).
- ❌ Native `<form>` tag POST submission — use `AfterAction_export` + `fetch` instead.
- ❌ The "API interface" for dynamic dropdown/select options from a server.

> ⚠️ SmarkForm is currently at **version 0.x**. The public API is stable for
> the implemented features, but breaking changes may still occur before 1.0.

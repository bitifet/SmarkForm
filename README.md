*SmarkForm* is a lightweight form library designed for front-end developers to
enhance HTML forms with powerful features like **subforms** and dynamic,
variable-length **lists**.

ðŸ”§ As a form controller, it seamlessly integrates with the DOM to provide a
CSS-agnostic solution, freeing your form layout from rigid styling constraints.
This no-dependencies vanilla JavaScript library enables **JSON form data import
and export**, ensuring compatibility with modern workflows.

â™¿ With a focus on accessibility (a11y), SmarkForm offers configurable hotkeys,
**smooth navigation**, and a **low-code experience**, making it an extendable
and versatile tool for building HTML form applications.
